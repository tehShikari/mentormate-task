//*** COMMENT SECTION


***the code should generate as many stars as the given number is + 2 on the bottom row + 2 on the bottom row
and - 2 hyphens on the next row from one part of the MM logo. When the 2 sets of stars(left and right) collide, the next row must go backwards
-> the stars go in the middle and they decrement -2, while hyphens go up +2, until the stars reach the beginning of the row
and stars and hyphens are the same number as initially given x

***it should be like: make 3 originally + new row with 2 more stars, although it should be 
calculated with the precise algorithm that displays the stars that overlap each other correctly.

***the length of the logo is N*10
where N is the number of stars in the 1st and last row, 1st and last rows are
simply turned around.

***the stars on the top row are as many as the hyphens. On every row, the hyphens decrement -1, until 
there are 0 hyphens on the 1st part of the bottom row -> until they are turned around.

***the stars divide themselves when they are about to collide and the next row has the same number of stars
in the middle as the previos row had 2 sets of the same number of stars, while on the 2 sides we get the initial
number of stars, until they reach the end of the line and they have completely turned around(the stars and the hyphens). On the last
row, the numbers of stars are equal to themselves and to the number of hyphens.

***on the 1st row we have     5- 5* 5- 5* 10- 5* 5- 5* 5-
on the last row we have       5* 5- 5* 5- 10* 5- 5* 5- 5*

***should use if(row.startsWith(logo.letterLeft)) for the last line -> so when on a new line the 1st symbol is *, it stops.

*** trying out pseudocode:

if x is odd && higher than minVal && lower than maxVal
    create a line of logo{} (each * x * 5) * 2 => 'MM'
//    create additional lines where logo.letter increments +1 on each side 
    now -> logo.letter.left/right +1 each, 
        left -> +1 * on the beginning;
        right -> +1 * on the end;
    while logo.space.left/middle/right decrements by 1 on each side
        left -> -1 on end;
        middle -> -1 on both sides;
        right -> -1 on start;
    until row.startsWith(logo.letterLeft) && row.startsWith(logo.letterRight);
    the rows' length is x + 1
    

***1st row x = (hyphens) = (stars);; 2nd row hyphens = x - 1 and stars = x + 2
every time until row.startsWith(logo.letterLeft) && row.endsWith(logo.letterRight)
 ^ this is for the left and right side of 'M'. while for the inner side:
they have to collide and mix, making a bigger amount of stars, yet the same amount
which is given is coming from every side -> \/ but also mixed like X
Yet, the 'X' is not complete, the bottom ends of it are missing a * each (that is in the middle)

*** while the number of rows is === to x, continue;
when the number of rows > x, return rows;


*** take x * logo.letterLeft

***swapping tea with coffee example
var str = "I like coffee more than I like tea";
var newStr = str.replace(/(coffee|tea)/g, function(x) {
   return x === "coffee" ? "tea" : "coffee";
});
alert(newStr); 

*** try out making the firstRow in the oddNum function and then the nextRow func in a while loop until row.startsWith("*")

letter = "*",
